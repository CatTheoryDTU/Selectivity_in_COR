The repository contains the bare DFT optimized geometries and energies included
in the folder `dft_data`. Here the thermodynamics (stable intermediates) and
kinetc minimum energy paths are given in separate directories. All the data has
been calculated on Cu(100).

Furthermore, the routine to reproduce the figures in the paper are given in the
directory `figures`. Each directory contains its own README.
